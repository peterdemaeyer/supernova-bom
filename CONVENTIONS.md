# Supernova Conventions

Indent using tabs, not spaces.

Rationale: using tabs does not rely on fixed-width fonts, allows users to define their indentation size per tab either
in spaces or even in cm or px, and they consume less characters.

Text files must end with a line separator.

Exception messages must be phrases and not sentences, using sentence case.
They must start with a lowercase letter and _not_ end with a punctuation mark.

Log messages must be sentences using sentence case. They must start with an uppercase letter and end with a punctuation
mark.
