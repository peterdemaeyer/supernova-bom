# Supernova

Supernova is a brand that defines the principles and standards of Peter De Maeyer's independent projects.

## Principles

Ultimately agile.
Everything must be made with change in mind.
For every imaginable change, there must be a process that supports it, however infrequent.
"We realize this is imperfect, but it's a design choice which is cast in stone" is never an acceptable answer.

Consistency.
A rule which requires fewer exceptions is preferable. 
Taste plays only a minor role in any choice.

Never wonder.
There must be rules for everything, such that one does never have to wonder "how should I do this?"
Should logging statements be in sentence case starting with a capital letter and ending with a full stop?
How should I start the first sentence of my Javadoc?
Never wonder, there are rules for everything.

## Standards

100 % code coverage.
